I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing \"Who was that singing ?\"   \n1                                                                                                                    Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries).

I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.   \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.   \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.   \n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.   \n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. \"Dr Shen Fu\", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.   \n9  Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               text  \\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Great CD My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me.

There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Batteries died within a year ... I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              works fine, but Maha Energy is better Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Great for the non-audiophile Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.   \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DVD Player crapped out after one year I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.   \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Incorrect Disc I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.   \n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      DVD menu select problems I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.   \n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. \"Dr Shen Fu\", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.   \n9  Not an \"ultimate guide\" Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.   \n\n                                               label  sentiment     score  \n0  {'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.8801992535591125}    Perfect  0.880199  \n1  {'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.6971486210823059}    Perfect  0.697149  \n2  {'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.5798621773719788}   Negative  0.579862  \n3   {'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.590337336063385}    Neutral  0.590337  \n4  {'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.5278475880622864}  Satisfied  0.527848  \n5   {'label': '1 star', 'score': 0.5352678894996643}   Negative  0.535268  \n6  {'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.4518487751483917}   Negative  0.451849  \n7   {'label': '1 star', 'score': 0.5147479772567749}   Negative  0.514748  \n8  {'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.7690035700798035}    Perfect  0.769004  \n9  {'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.5435159802436829}    Neutral  0.543516  ","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>title</th>\n      <th>content</th>\n      <th>text</th>\n      <th>label</th>\n      <th>sentiment</th>\n      <th>score</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Great CD</td>\n      <td>My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation.

She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.   \n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...   \n176984                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My 4 year old received this for her birthday and she loves it. We take turns making surprise pictures for one another with the internal game. The machine is easy for her to handle and is helping with her hand and eye cordination. I do wish that they would have left the commercial out and included another game but it's a very small complaint for a great toy.   \n176995                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I bought my almost 4 year old the leapster after returning the V-tech V-smile (see my review of the V-smile for more info).I am really pleased with it so far. Graphics are good, the stylus pen it comes with is easy to use, and the games seem much more educational than the V-smile ones. My only real complaint is that the colors on the screen are sometimes hard to distinguish, but maybe I need to see it with 3 year old eyes. Anyway, so far so good, seems to be worth the $$ I shelled out for it. I also like the portability of this thing-it will make long car rides a bit more pleasant for everyone I hope.   \n176999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good phone if you want something inexpensive. I did not have problems with the answering machine resetting as I had read in a previous review (sounds like that person got a defective machine). Bought mine a month ago and am very happy with it.   \n177003                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Here's the plot- some cool criminals in a not too distant future industrial London steal cars, only to drive them into posh shopping malls to loot what they can before hearing police sirens, basically for the rush- wicked. This debut from PAUL ANDERSON (EVENT HORIZON) is a nifty little film that manages to exite in it's short running time. Gritty and well acted by some up and comming English talent (SEAN PERTWEE is excellent as usual as a tough scumbag), this flick has some slick production for an indie. A movie that looks good, moves with purpose, and draws the viewer into a world of grime and crime is always worth it.   \n177006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This is a great product the only \"problem\" we have had is: attaching the wall mount to the wall and still having a centered television - it's impossible to center the television because of where our studs are in the wall. Our preferred method of \"fixing\" the problem was to have a longer wall plate constructed (special) - so that we have room to actually slide the television into the center.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    text  \\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   works fine, but Maha Energy is better Check out Maha Energy's website.

However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.   \n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Okay but Messy.... We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.   \n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Great Beginning...poor ending Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning!

I bought my almost 4 year old the leapster after returning the V-tech V-smile (see my review of the V-smile for more info).I am really pleased with it so far. Graphics are good, the stylus pen it comes with is easy to use, and the games seem much more educational than the V-smile ones. My only real complaint is that the colors on the screen are sometimes hard to distinguish, but maybe I need to see it with 3 year old eyes. Anyway, so far so good, seems to be worth the $$ I shelled out for it. I also like the portability of this thing-it will make long car rides a bit more pleasant for everyone I hope.   \n176999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Good phone for the price Good phone if you want something inexpensive.

firstly,i enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). however, i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. if you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, i recommend some more topic-specific books. for example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards lsat preparation (powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.   \n48

left the ship. the bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. at first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and

and i know one of the agents this movie is about. i was really looking forward to seeing this. the problem is the movie just can't decide whether it is a serious piece covering the very interesting true story of an informant with huge problems of his own or whether it is a comedy or a spoof. it does a poor job of being funny and a poor job of being serious. another reviewer called the movie \"quirky.\" that is a good description, but not in the sense that some movies are good because they are quirky. this is quirky in the sense that the director just doesn't seem to have a clear vision of what this movie is intended to be.\nsentiment

week. the book is easy to read, and the message is clear. what i like the most is that it doesn't give you a secret formula, a snake oil recipe or silver bullet, but instead go down to basics. i loved the book and i'm now reading another one from his collection. the sooner you read it, the faster you'll be able to achieve your financial goal. whichever this might be. i hope you enjoy it as much as i did. cheers!\nsentiment

are usually filled with other additives like corn and artificial ingredients. they're relatively low fat and taste like the real thing. my only complaint is that they are very salty even thought the manufacturer claims that they are \"lightly salted\".\nsentiment

strained with this album. as always he add's his voals to some tracks. his voice while okay on the first album has gotten steaily worse. becoming both grating and often incomprehensible. the lyrics have become almost mundane in there effort to be amibigious. it is still listenable but i do not suggest playing it along side the previous albums\nsentiment

firstly i enjoyed the format and tone of the book  how the author addressed the reader   however  i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal  if you are just starting to research law school  and do not know all the requirements of admission  then this book may be a tremendous help  if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to
